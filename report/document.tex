\section{Introduction}

Describe the Knight Tour problem and the research question here.
Research questions that we discuss in this report include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item How can the Knight’s Tour problem be logically modeled so that it is solvable with Answer Set Programming (ASP)?
    \item Which different logical models can be used to formulate the problem?
    \item How does the size of the chessboard affect the complexity and solution methods?
    \item How can heuristics and multi-shot solving techniques be applied to improve the efficiency of solving the Knight’s Tour problem with Answer Set Programming (ASP)?
\end{itemize}
